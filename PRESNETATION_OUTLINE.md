- Presented by: [Your Name]
- Date: [Current Date]

## Slide 2: Agenda
- Phase V Objectives
- Advanced Features Overview
- Architecture Deep Dive
- Event-Driven Implementation
- Dapr Integration

- Q&A

## Slide 3: Phase V Objectives
- Implement advanced features (recurring tasks, due date reminders)
- Add event-driven architecture with Kafka
- Implement Dapr for distributed application runtime
- Deploy to Minikube locally and cloud (AKS/GKE)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline and monitoring

## Slide 4: Advanced Features Delivered
- Recurring tasks with configurable patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Due date reminders with scheduling system
- Enhanced UI with priority and categorization
- AI-powered task management with advanced context

## Slide 5: Architecture Overview
- High-level view of the event-driven, microservices architecture
- Frontend, Backend, Kafka, Dapr, and external services
- Clear separation of concerns

## Slide 6: Event-Driven Architecture
- Kafka as the backbone for asynchronous communication
- Task events, reminder events, and update events
- Loose coupling between services
- Scalability benefits

## Slide 7: Dapr Integration
- Distributed Application Runtime benefits
- Pub/Sub, State Management, Service Invocation, Secrets
- Language-agnostic microservices
- Infrastructure abstraction

## Slide 8: Deployment Strategy
- Local: Minikube with Strimzi and Dapr
- Cloud: AKS/GKE with Redpanda Cloud
- Helm charts for consistent deployments
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Slide 9: Demo Setup
- Live application running on Minikube
- Kafka event monitoring
- Dapr dashboard
- Application UI

## Slide 10: Demo - Recurring Tasks
- Show AI creating a recurring task
- Demonstrate next occurrence generation
- Explain event-driven process

## Slide 11: Demo - Due Date Reminders
- Create task with due date
- Show reminder scheduling
- Explain Kafka event publishing

## Slide 12: Demo - Event-Driven Architecture
- Monitor Kafka topics in real-time
- Show events generated by task operations
- Explain how other services can consume these events

## Slide 13: Demo - Dapr Integration
- Show Dapr sidecars in action
- Demonstrate service invocation
- Explain state and secret management

## Slide 14: Scalability & Monitoring
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Prometheus metrics
- Cloud deployment readiness

## Slide 15: Key Benefits
